# RECORD Validation Summary

## Overview
We've analyzed the RECORD validation results for the sampled papers. So far, 7 papers have been processed with the RECORD checklist:

1. 31537841.pdf - 100% agreement
2. 34338412.pdf - 100% agreement
3. 35870161.pdf - 100% agreement
4. 28472213.pdf - 100% agreement
5. 31405419.pdf - 100% agreement
6. 30853444.pdf - 100% agreement
7. 24972918.pdf - 95.74% agreement (needs manual review)

## Paper Requiring Manual Review

### 24972918.pdf
- Agreement rate: 95.74%
- Total items: 47
- Agree with extractor: 45
- Disagree with extractor: 1
- Unknown: 0

#### Specific Disagreement
The disagreement is on item 12.0.a: "Describe all statistical methods, including those used to control for confounding."

**Extractor's Answer:**
No, the paper does not describe methods used to control for confounding factors.

**Validator's Reasoning:**
The evidence provided describes the statistical methods used for analyzing the data, but does not mention any methods used to control for confounding factors, which is a key part of the checklist item.

**Evidence:**
- "Pain relief and opioid usage were evaluated for median differences using the Wilcoxon signed-rank test. In order to analyze the non-normal data distribution (Fig. 3) appropriately, results are reported as medianÂ±absolute deviation (as opposed to means, the former being resistant to outliers). All computations were performed using Stata Statistical Software, Release 12 (StataCorp LP, College Station, TX). For all statistical analyses, an alpha of 0.05 was used." (Statistical analysis section)

#### Analysis of Disagreement
There appears to be a contradiction in the validation. The validator selected "do not agree with extractor" but their reasoning actually aligns with the extractor's assessment. Both the extractor and validator note that the paper does not describe methods used to control for confounding factors. This suggests a potential error in the validation process rather than a genuine disagreement about the paper's content.

## Recommendation
This paper should be manually reviewed to resolve the apparent contradiction in the validation. The specific focus should be on item 12.0.a and whether the paper actually describes methods to control for confounding factors.

## Next Steps
1. Continue processing the remaining papers with the RECORD checklist
2. Periodically run the analysis scripts to identify any additional papers that need manual review
3. Conduct a detailed review of the identified paper (24972918.pdf) focusing on the specific disagreement
